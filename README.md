## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **440 wholesale clients** in Portugal and their **annual spending** (standardized monetary units) across 6 product categories. It also includes metadata on **sales channel** and **region**.

|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Channel             | 1 = Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/CafÃ©), 2 = Retail                |
| Region              | 1 = Lisbon, 2 = Oporto, 3 = Other Regions                     |
| Fresh               | Spending on fresh products                                    |
| Milk                | Spending on milk products                                     |
| Grocery             | Spending on grocery products                                  |

## ðŸ§ª Analysis Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**:  
   - Filtered numerical spending columns for clustering  
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler

2. **Clustering**:  
   - Applied **K-Means** clustering (optimal k = 3 via Elbow & Silhouette)  
   - Cluster labels reattached to original data for profiling

3. **Profiling**:  
   - Analyzed each clusterâ€™s average spending distribution and channel/region mix

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Used PCA plot and bar charts to illustrate segment traits

- **Suggestion**: Focus on dry-goods building and optimize delivery frequency to reduce operational costs.

### **1. Fresh Product Focused**
- **Traits**: High Fresh; low Detergents and Deli.
- **Channel**: 75% Horeca.
- **Interpretation**: Likely restaurants, cafÃ©s, or markets with frequent small orders.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure reliable, frequent, fresh deliveries tailored to their short inventory cycles.

### **2. High-Value Niche Clients**
- **Traits**: Extremely high overall spend; strong preference for Frozen and Delicatessen.

## ðŸ§  Future Work

- Gather qualitative business-type information to validate cluster persona.
- Integrate monthly or quarterly sales data to analyze seasonal demand patterns.
- Study transaction-level data to uncover delivery frequency or minimum order size.
